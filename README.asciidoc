About reLightVC 
===============

reLightVC is a port of Anthony Bush's LightVC PHP Framework
(http://www.lightvc.org/). The original framework hasn't had a new release
since 2008.

The planned changes for reLightVC are: 

- add in a class autoloader
-- It's 2011, include() or require() is so 2009
- create a JSON only Controller 
- add in PHPUnit tests for all parts
-- includes making a base class for testing the framework
- redo the configuration system 
-- maybe Documentation as Code type parser
- add in a lightweight bootstrapping system
- improve the documentation
